        Don't Deflate the Soufflé

        <h3>Hey you! I need you to help me get this soufflé to the other side of this noisy kitchen without deflating it.</h3>
            
            <p>Use the arrow keys to avoid oil spills and loud talkers. Beware of the dreaded non-electric pressure cooker. A timer will be set for when it goes off, and you must be out of the kitchen with the soufflé or else it will be deflated for sure!</p>
